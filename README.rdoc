== GitHub Repo Code Search

Just a breakable toy Rails 4 app to search my personal Gists on GitHub using Solr (WebSolr+Sunspot) and the GitHub API. Also, uses Omniauth+Devise for GitHub authentication, but not leveraging it for anything related to Gist searching yet.

This is a playground that may include more experiements.
