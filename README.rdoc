== GitHub Repo Code Search

Just a [breakable toy](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys) Rails 4 app to search my personal Gists on GitHub using Solr (WebSolr+Sunspot) and the GitHub API. Also, uses Omniauth+Devise for GitHub authentication, but not leveraging it for anything related to Gist searching yet.

This is a playground that may include more experiements.
